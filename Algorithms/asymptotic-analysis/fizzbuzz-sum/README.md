# Problem statement
One of the main lessons I hope you take away from this module is that by having a sense of the complexity classes of certain algorithmic approaches, you will often have a very strong hint of what you would need to do to substantially improve upon an algorithm.

Here, I give you a problem with a somewhat obvious O(n) solution. I suggest that you could do better, which means that it would need to be something like O(log n), O(sqrt n) or O(1). Over time, you will develop a sense of what kind of algorithms have these kinds of running times. In this case, if we're encouraged to look for a constant time solution, that requires us to find a mathematical expression for the problem which allows us to compute the answer without iteration.

Incidentally, this is the first problem of [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/problem=1), a problem set for which I have great fondness. I still remember my first experiences of submitting a solution, then the excitement of seeing everybody else's clever, creative, or just zany alternative approaches. If you like mathy problems, you may enjoy it too.

# Notes
- Usage of the formula for the sum of arithmetic progression helps solve this problem in constant time
