## Problem statement
While the first binary search was published in 1946, the first published binary search without bugs did not appear until 1962! Being a deceptively straightforward algorithm, the challenge is to avoid bugs when handling edge cases. Inspired by Jon Bentley's article [Writing correct programs](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/358476.358484), I show you how to use a loop invariant to more confidently solve subtle problems like this.
